On planet M10-C there lives people who mine a valuable ore called "metamix". It is sold throughout the galaxy to produce metaverses.

One day, our space person lands to eat their famous barbeque.
He goes down the elevator and eat a nice barbeque among the inhabitants of the planet. Having a fun time.
But then, the elevator breaks!

They communicate with the surface but they say they can't fix it for a month!

They all have to find a new way to the surface, going through dark tunnels and meeting weird blind creatues living inside.

One creature is cute and decides to fall asleep in someones backpack. They wake up when they get to the surface.
